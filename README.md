# Week 1 - Xcode and Swift

This file contains a summary of the information in lab01.html. That file contains the lab 
instructions and should be opened in a browser so you can see all the images.

* **Fork** this git repository (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
* Familiarise yourself with the Xcode development environment
* Create a new Xcode project
* Write a Swift program
* Debug a Swift program
* Commit changes to your forked repository

You should have created a new project and have your emojiate source code inside
it. Once you have this make sure your forked repo has stored the changes (hint:
`git add` and `git commit`).

If you are having problems with the `git` commands, refer to the following links:

* https://github.com (create an account here)
* https://education.github.com/pack/offers
* https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git
* https://guides.github.com

Make sure you sign up for the education pack (you get unlimitied private 
repositories for free while you're a student). If you don't want to do use 
github then let the lecturers know.
